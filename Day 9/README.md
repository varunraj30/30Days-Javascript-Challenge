# Day 9 of Javascript Challenge

## 1.Get Element By ID and change its text content.

```Javascript
const head = document.getElementById("head")
head.textContent = "Changed text content"
//console.log(head) -> <div id="head" class="heading" style="color: red; background-color: orange;">Changed text content</div>
```

## Lessons Learned

getElementById is used to grab elements by its ID. There are few ways to change its text content<br>
1.InnerHTML-> Includes HTML tags also.<br>
2.InnerText-> Contents which are only visible (example: elements which are blocked using CSS they won't be visible).<br>
3.InnerContent-> Everything will be visible even if elements are blocked by CSS apart from HTML tags.<br>

## 2.Get Element By ClassName and change its background color.

```Javascript
const heading = document.getElementsByClassName("heading")
// console.log(heading);
// HTMLCollectionÂ [div#head.heading, head: div#head.heading]
heading[0].style.backgroundColor = "orange"
```

## Lessons Learned

getElementsByClassName is used to grab all elements by its className.<br>
Output will be of HTML collection. We can mention its index value or loop and update the values accordingly.

## 3.Create a new div element with some text and append it to the body.

```Javascript
const div = document.createElement("div")
div.textContent = "Create a div element"
document.body.appendChild(div)
```

## Lessons Learned

createElement is used to create Element<br>
Learned the difference between append and appendChild<br>
append -> can append multiple Nodes to parentNode<br>
appendChild -> can only append singleNode to parentNode

## 4.Create a new li element and add it to existing ul list.

```Javascript
const ul= document.getElementById("ul")
console.log(ul);
const newLi = document.createElement("li")
newLi.textContent="Python"
ul.appendChild(newLi)
```

## 5.Select an HTML element and remove it from DOM.

```Javascript
const li = document.getElementsByClassName("li")
console.log(li);
li[1].remove()
```

## Lessons Learned

Created two elements with li className.Grabbed all the elements having className "li" and removed last element from the DOM.

## 6.Remove the last child from specific element.

```Javascript
const li = document.querySelector("li:last-child")
console.log(li)
li.remove()
```

## Lessons Learned

querySelector is used to grab first element with the mentioned parameter.Here I have tried to grab last child of li element and removed from the DOM.

## 7.Select an HTML element and change one of its attributes.

```Javascript
const img = document.querySelector("img")
console.log(img)
img.setAttribute("src","https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRAvQn9r0KIJurVLI0_ozLa9D_l4buf2VT25g&s")
```

## Lessons Learned

setAttribute is used to add new attribute to the element.If the attribute already exists, it overwrites the existing one. In the above example, old src is replaced by new src.<br>
getAttribute is used to get all the attributes from the element.
